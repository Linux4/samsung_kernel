	  Say Y here if you want to build support for NFC (Near field
	  communication) devices.
	  To compile this support as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called nfc.

	help
	  NXP SN2XX Near Field Communication controller support
	  This option enables device driver support for the NFC.
	  It is used by many services. NFC is fully controlled using I2C
	  to communicate the AP chip.

	depends on SPI
	help
	  This enables the Secure Element driver for SNxxx based devices.
	  If unsure, say N.
	  This selects Secure Element support.
	  If you want NFC support, you should say Y here and
	  also to your specific host controller driver.

          Using eSE platform driver.
          Sometimes eSE node is created after permission setting
          cause of SPI driver dependency.
          So, use platform driver to make node first.

        help
          This enables the NFC driver for SNxxx based devices.
          This is for I2C connected version. NCI protocol logic
          resides in the usermode and it has no other NFC dependencies.

          If unsure, say N.
