config NFC_WILINK
	tristate "Texas Instruments NFC WiLink driver"
	depends on TI_ST && NFC_NCI
	help
	  This enables the NFC driver for Texas Instrument's BT/FM/GPS/NFC
	  combo devices. This makes use of shared transport line discipline
	  core driver to communicate with the NFC core of the combo chip.

	  Say Y here to compile support for Texas Instrument's NFC WiLink driver
	  into the kernel or say M to compile it as module.

config NFC_MEI_PHY
	tristate "MEI bus NFC device support"
	depends on INTEL_MEI && NFC_HCI
	help
	  This adds support to use an mei bus nfc device. Select this if you
	  will use an HCI NFC driver for an NFC chip connected behind an
	  Intel's Management Engine chip.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFC_SIM
	tristate "NFC hardware simulator driver"
	help
	  This driver declares two virtual NFC devices supporting NFC-DEP
	  protocol. An LLCP connection can be established between them and
	  all packets sent from one device is sent back to the other, acting as
	  loopback devices.

	  If unsure, say N.

config ST21NFCA
	bool "ST Microelectronics ST21NFCA NFC Controller Driver"
	depends on I2C && GPIOLIB
	default n
	---help---
	  ST NFC driver.
	  ST Microelectronics ST21NFCA Near Field Communication
	  controller support.

	  Say Y here to compile support for ST devices into the
	  kernel or say N to disable.

config SEC_NFC
	bool "Samsung NFC driver"
	default n
	help
	  SAMSUNG NFC Driver.
	  This driver provides support for SAMSUNG NFC products.
	  You should select your NFC product and interface.
	  Say Y here to compile support for SAMSUNG NFC driver into the
	  kernel.

	bool "External clock control (RF clock)"
	depends on SEC_NFC_PRODUCT_N5
	default n
	help
	  Driver controls NFC external clock.
	  This option should be enabled to control NFC external clock.
	  you should select if your NFC device requests exnternal clock.
	  Say Y here to compile support for exnternal clock control in the kernel.

config NFC_PN547
	tristate "NXP PN547 NFC Controller Driver"
	depends on I2C
	default n
	---help---
	  NXP PN547 Near Field Communication controller support.
	  This option enables device driver support for the NFC.
	  It is used by many services. NFC is fully controlled using I2C
          to communicate the AP chip.

config BCM2079X_NFC_I2C
	tristate "BCM2079X NFC driver for I2C interface"
	depends on I2C
	default n
	---help---
	  Say yes if you want BCM2079X Near Field Communication driver.
	  This is for i2c connected version. If unsure, say N here.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose m here. The module will be called bcm2079x-i2c.

config SEC_NFC_GPIO_LDO_CONTROL
	bool "SEC NFC GPIO LDO CONTROL"
	depends on SEC_NFC
	default n
	help
	SAMSUNG SEC NFC GPIO LDO CONTROL feature.
	This feature provides support for SAMSUNG NFC products.
	You should select this feature if your NFC product uses GPIO to turn on ldo
	control of i2c and PVDD.

	Say Y here to compile support for SEC NFC GPIO LDO CONTROL feature
	into the kernel.

config SEC_NFC_LDO_CONTROL
	bool "SEC NFC LDO CONTROL"
	depends on SEC_NFC
	default n
	help
